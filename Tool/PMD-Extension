We implemented an extension of PMD, defining rules for each type of LA based on their definitions to detect the LAs. 
The eclipse-plugin is attached.

To use the Tool you need to do the following steps:

1- Download the needed jar files and put them into the lib folder:
ejml-0.23.jar
joda-time.jar
jollyday.jar
jwnl.jar
protobuf.jar
slf4j-api.jar
slf4j-simple.jar
stanford-corenlp-3.8.0.jar
stanford-corenlp-3.8.0-models.jar
xom.jar

2- Then, paste all the folders into the /plugins direction from your eclipse folder. 
3- Import the ruleset. In eclipse -> go to Window -> Preferences and select the Ruleset selection tab in the PMD category. 
4- Browse to the path of my custom ruleset which is in the bin folder of the plug-in under the name LA_ruleset.xml. 
5- Press the Add rule set button. The custom rule set should be added to the list.
6- Press OK to close the Preferences dialog.
